# Experiment 1: Resizing, Filtering, and Thresholding

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## 📌 Objective
Perform the following operations on an input image:
1. **Resizing** to 300x300 pixels
2. **Filtering** using Gaussian Blur
3. **Thresholding** (Binary)

## 📂 Files
- `exp1.py`: Python script for the experiment
- `image.jpg`: Input image (keep it in the same folder)
- `output_sample.png`: Output image (optional, saved after thresholding)

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python exp1.py
```

Make sure you are inside this folder when running.

## 🖼 Expected Output
- Resized image display
- Blurred image display
- Thresholded image display
- Output image saved as `output_sample.png`
